## LWC-ASIC

LWC: Leightweight Cryptography (A NIST competition for cryptographic standardization)

ASIC: Application specific integrated circuit (A mikrochip)

The LWC-ASIC organization bundles the ressources to create real mikrochips (ASIC) with build-in Leightweight Cryptography algorithms (LWC). The premise is to do everything in open-source, even the building of the ASIC.
